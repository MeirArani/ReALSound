# Defense Review
### Tell a Story 
- Fuck the tech focus
- Tell a simple story instead
- "There was a problem"
- "I thought this about the problem"
- "I came up with this idea"
- "it basically works like this"
- "I made a prototype"
- "Here's how it works"
### Center on the video
- Build up to showing the video
	- That's the focal point
- Explain things only to illustrate how the video's logic works
- Then demonstrate the video again without the visuals
### Know your audience
- They're not tech engineers 
- They're the common clay of the new West
- Ya know....*morons*
