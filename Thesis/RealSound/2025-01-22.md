Both too much and too little. 

Useful information is hardly ever distributed in useful ways. We mostly receive a daily torrent of emails that make it nearly impossible to filter out the signal from the noise. Most emails are irrelevant junk that eventually lead students to build up a habit of ignoring their inbox. Who could blame them? They receive glorified spam messages nearly every hour of the day. 

Sending out the same email every single week just because an event occurs weekly is so poorly thought out...I don't know how I can explain *why* its so bad. It's just such as obviously bad idea on the face of it.
Imagine that our emails were instead phone calls. Do you want to get the same phone call every single Wednesday at 3 PM to remind you about some sort of job hunting seminar on Friday? I'm pretty confident in betting that 99.9% of respondents would say *no.* Remember: if *you* don't want it, your students don't want it either.
