- Discuss required attributes 
	- lost frames
- Discuss difficulties of losing objects
	- Collides with score card 
	- Hit can make either object disappear 
- Discuss difficulties of hit detection
	- Distance isn't always a valid measure 
		- Close misses on top or bottom
	- Pong has irregular collision detection behavior 
		- Balls that should miss might get caught 
	- Assumes hit is captured in frame
		- Frame drops or other visual issues might obscure a hit 
- Discuss Fan projects
	- Ship of Harkinian etc
- Discuss dependency issues 
	- Ball requires P1 information for calculation 
		- Who should manage an audio object?
## Implementation Difficulties 
- Functionality of QT 
	- No pitch manipulate for Spatial Audio 
- Merging disparate software libraries 
### Designing a good Audio Display
- Many iterations and variations 
	- All of them tend to lose some key data
- Generic HRTFs 
	- Demand generic solutions that lose out on some opportunities
		- Elevation understanding
		- Cone of Confusion 
- Fast-paced nature of games
	- Demands some clever design
		- Need to understand the *trajectory* of actions, not just their current state
